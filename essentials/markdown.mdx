## Document Headers

### Main Section Headers (H2)

Use H2 headers (##) to create main sections in your document. These headers automatically create anchor links and appear in the table of contents.

```md
## Main Section Headers
```

### Subsection Headers (H3)

Use H3 headers (###) to create logical subsections under your main topics. These also generate anchors and appear in the navigation.

```md
### Subsection Headers
```

<Tip>
Each header level (H2 and H3) automatically:
- Creates an anchor link for direct navigation
- Appears in the right-side table of contents
- Helps organize your content hierarchically
</Tip>

## Basic Text Formatting

### Bold and Italic Text

Make your text stand out using bold and italic formatting. Here's how to use them:

| Style   | Syntax    | Result    |
| ------- | --------- | --------- |
| Bold    | `**bold**`| **bold**  |
| Italic  | `_italic_`| _italic_  |

### Strikethrough Text

Use strikethrough to show removed or deprecated content:

| Style         | Syntax           | Result          |
| ------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Strikethrough | `~strikethrough~`| ~strikethrough~ |

<Note>
You can combine different text styles. For example:
`**_bold and italic_**` becomes **_bold and italic_**
</Note>

## Advanced Formatting

### Superscript and Subscript

Use HTML tags for superscript and subscript text:

| Text Style  | Syntax                  | Result                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Superscript | `<sup>superscript</sup>`| <sup>superscript</sup>|
| Subscript   | `<sub>subscript</sub>`  | <sub>subscript</sub>  |

## Page Navigation

### Internal Links

When linking to other pages in your documentation, use root-relative paths:

```md
[link to another page](/folder/page-name)
```

<Warning>
Avoid using relative paths like `../page-name`. These load slower and are harder to maintain.
</Warning>

### External Links

For external websites, use the standard markdown link syntax:

```md
[link to google](https://google.com)
```

## Block Elements

### Single-line Blockquotes

Add a `>` before your text to create a simple blockquote:

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
```

### Multi-line Blockquotes

For longer quotes, use multiple `>` characters with empty lines between paragraphs:

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

## Mathematical Expressions

### LaTeX Support

Mintlify supports [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) equations through the Latex component:

<Latex>8 x (vk x H1 - H2) = (0,1)</Latex>

```md
<Latex>8 x (vk x H1 - H2) = (0,1)</Latex>
```

<Tip>
Use LaTeX for complex mathematical formulas, equations, and scientific notation.
